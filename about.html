                <h2>Our Mission</h2>
                  <p>
  At <strong>EcoTales</strong>, our mission is to make climate education meaningful, relatable, 
  and action-oriented for the people of Pakistan—especially the younger generation who will shape our future.
</p>

<p>
  Floods are not just natural disasters; they are powerful reminders of how climate change impacts our lives, 
  our homes, and our communities. Through storytelling, real-time data, and interactive tools, EcoTales helps 
  learners understand the science behind floods while also connecting it to the human stories on the ground.
</p>

<p>
  We believe that awareness is the first step toward resilience. By combining climate science, real-time flood data, 
  and AI-powered insights, we aim to inspire young people to take action, build solutions, and become leaders in 
  the fight against climate change. Together, we can turn knowledge into empowerment, and empowerment into action—for 
  a safer, more resilient Pakistan.
